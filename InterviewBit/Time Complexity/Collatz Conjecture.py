# Given two integers A and B, where A is the first element of the sequence then find Bth element of the sequence.
# If the kth element of the sequence is X then k+1th element calculated as:
# if X is even then next element is X/2.
# else next element is 3Ã—X + 1.

# Problem Constraints
# 1 <= A <= 109
# 1 <= B <= 105

# Input Format
# Given two integers A and B.

# Output Format
# Return an integer.

# Example Input
# Input 1:
# A = 1
# B = 3

# Input 2:
# A = 5
# B = 6

# Example Output
# Output 1:
# 2
# Output 2:
# 1

# Example Explanation
# Explanation 1:
#  The sequence is as follows 1 -> 4 -> 2
# Explanation 2:
# The sequence is as follows 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
